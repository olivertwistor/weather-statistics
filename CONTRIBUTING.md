I'm happy that you are interested in contributing to this project. The open source community depends on people like you, and together we can make this project as good as it can possibly be. Thank you!

This document describes, first of all, code of conduct (a very important read), then some ideas of with what you may contribute and, last but not least, explanations on what you must do to start working on an issue and get your work merged into this project.

## Code of conduct
The open source community should be open and welcoming for all. I have a zero tolerance policy against discrimination of race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability etc.

I urge everyone to be respectful to each other and remember that behind that username is a human being. If someone makes a mistake or makes a "stupid" comment or question, please bear in mind that they may be a beginner, something everyone has once been.

Feel free to e-mail me at [oliver_twistor@hotmail.com][1] if you have any questions or complaints regarding this or anything else.
